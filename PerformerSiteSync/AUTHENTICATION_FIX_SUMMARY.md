# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The PerformerSiteSync plugin was experiencing "401 Unauthorized" errors because individual modules were creating new unauthenticated `StashInterface()` instances instead of using the authenticated instance from `ConfigManager`.

## Root Cause
- `ConfigManager` was correctly using `server_connection` from Stash and authenticating properly
- However, `PerformerSync`, `FavoritePerformers`, and `FavoriteSites` modules were all creating new `StashInterface()` instances without authentication
- This bypassed the authentication that was working in `ConfigManager`

## Files Fixed

### 1. PerformerSiteSync/modules/performer_sync.py
- **FIXED**: Constructor now uses `config_manager.stash` instead of creating `StashInterface()`
- **REMOVED**: Unnecessary `StashInterface` import
- **CLEANED**: Removed duplicate constructor code

### 2. PerformerSiteSync/modules/favorite_performers.py  
- **FIXED**: Constructor now uses `config_manager.stash` instead of creating `StashInterface()`
- **REMOVED**: Unnecessary `StashInterface` import
- **CLEANED**: Fixed file corruption from duplicate headers

### 3. PerformerSiteSync/modules/favorite_sites.py
- **FIXED**: Constructor now uses `config_manager.stash` instead of creating `StashInterface()`  
- **REMOVED**: Unnecessary `StashInterface` import

### 4. PerformerSiteSync/modules/config.py
- **UNCHANGED**: Already working correctly with `server_connection`
- **CONFIRMED**: Uses authenticated `StashInterface(server_connection)` properly

## Testing Approach
1. Created `test_auth.py` to verify authentication works
2. Plugin site has been built with fixes
3. Ready for testing in Stash environment

## Expected Result
- No more "401 Unauthorized" errors
- All modules now inherit authentication from `ConfigManager.stash`
- Plugin should connect successfully to local Stash instance

## Test Steps for Stash
1. Install updated plugin from built site
2. Run any plugin operation (performer sync, favorites, etc.)
3. Check logs for successful authentication messages
4. Verify no "401 Unauthorized" errors appear
